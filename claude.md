## [NITIN OWNS] WHY THIS EXISTS
Nitin wants to learn Astrology, starting from all the foundational concepts like sunsign, moon sign, rising sign, planet house, dasha, lagna and the interplay around this
Nitin is looking to build a application, that can be used for daily Astrology todo, to avoids. (no major predictions, nothing). Based on kundali of user.

ONe main application is in Finance. Where i am looking to give some indication on market mood, volatility, price movement of major metals like GOld, Silver, Crude etc. And major indexes
I want to plugin in this service in my other trading application where at tthe start of session i look at market macros, Astro probability weighted direction prediction.

Given date , time and place of birth i want to be able to tell the sunsign moon sign and etc. Already implemented in main.

Now to predict stock prices etc, do we need to get the compnay formation details, time, place etc ?
