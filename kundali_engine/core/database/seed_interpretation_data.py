         "Next time you're tempted to be clever, choose to be curious instead. Depth of understanding matters more than breadth of knowledge.", 2),
        (10, "Your soul carries deep attachment to emotional safety and domestic comfort. In relationships, you nurture compulsively and avoid career ambition because it threatens closeness.",
         "Your growth requires building a professional identity independent of your family role. Your partner needs to see you as a public person, not just a private one.",
         "The tension between career ambition and home comfort is your primary growth edge. This life weights professional development more heavily.", 2),
        (11, "Your soul carries the performer's need for personal recognition and romantic intensity. In relationships, you gravitate toward drama rather than stable community connections.",
         "Find fulfillment in group belonging and shared goals. The friendships that sustain you long-term matter more than the romances that thrill you short-term.",
         "Celebrate someone else's achievement this week as if it were your own. Moving beyond personal glory into collective success is your emotional growth edge.", 2),
        (12, "Your soul carries a deep habit of staying busy to avoid inner emptiness. In relationships, you serve others compulsively rather than opening to spiritual vulnerability.",
         "Practice being still without feeling useless. Your deepest relationships will deepen when you stop trying to fix your partner and simply be present.",

        (2, "You carry mastery of transformation and hidden knowledge from previous lives. Valuable tools, but over-reliance on crisis mode prevents you from building lasting foundations.",
         "Develop your relationship with money, food, and family as sacred practices, not mundane obligations. Valuing simple pleasures is your spiritual growth edge.",
         "Build one financial habit this month that feels almost too simple. Sustainable abundance comes from consistency, not dramatic breakthroughs.", 3),
        (3, "Your past-life expertise in higher learning and philosophy is a genuine gift. But reaching for big-picture meaning is actually avoidance of mastering everyday skills.",
         "Challenge yourself to learn something practical — a craft, a language, a technical skill. Growth comes from getting your hands dirty with small, useful knowledge.",
         "Write something short and practical every week. Your cosmic wisdom needs a practical delivery system, and that's what this life is for.", 3),
        (4, "You've mastered public life and career building in previous incarnations. Real skills, but they've become an escape from emotional intimacy and inner work.",
         "Invest as much energy in your home environment as in your career. Emotional security is the foundation all your outer achievements rest on.",
         "This week, prioritize one home connection over one career task. Retrain your sense of what 'productive' really means.", 3),
        (5, "Your past-life mastery of networks and group dynamics is a gift, but it's become a shield against personal creative risk. You default to group consensus instead of personal feeling.",
         "Start one creative project that is entirely yours — not collaborative, not crowd-sourced. Let it be imperfect. Your evolution requires individual expression.",

        (6, "Your past-life spiritual practice gave you genuine depth, but it also created avoidance of daily responsibility. Letting go became code for not engaging.",
         "Build a daily health routine, tackle workplace challenges head-on, and develop practical problem-solving skills. These are your spiritual practice now.",
         "Set one practical health or work goal this week and follow through completely. Your moksha-oriented soul needs grounding in service to evolve further.", 3),
        (7, "Your past-life independence is a genuine strength, but it's become a barrier to deep partnerships. Doing everything yourself isn't courage — it's avoidance of intimacy.",
         "Actively seek a partner or collaborator whose perspective genuinely challenges yours. Evolution happens through the friction of real partnership.",
         "Next time you want to handle something alone, intentionally bring someone in. Collaboration is your karmic curriculum — lean into it.", 3),
        (8, "Your past-life wealth and stability were genuine blessings, but they created surface-level engagement. You default to comfort when life calls for depth.",
